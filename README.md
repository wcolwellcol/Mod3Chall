# Mod3Chall
Repo for Week 3 Challenge of Fintech Course

-------------
### Overview
The goal of this project is to identify historical arbitrage opportunities for bitcoin. We compare the price history for bitcoin from two exchanges and identify areas in which profitable arbitrage exists. 

Code can be found in the following notebook [crypto_arbitrage.ipynb](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod3Chall/blob/main/crypto_arbitrage.ipynb).

Data for this project is sourced from two csvs: [bitstamp.csv](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod3Chall/blob/main/Resources/bitstamp.csv) and [coinbase.csv](https://github.com/wcolwellcol/Mod3Chall/blob/main/Resources/coinbase.csv).

In general, the code can be split into 3 different categories: data collection, data preparation, and data analysis.
